Hey! I am trying out Zola. Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Cum veritatis tempore velit provident officia illo nostrum commodi fugiat incidunt! Nihil repellat deleniti omnis ea suscipit, obcaecati magnam quibusdam dignissimos illo.

So far:

- The documentation could be be improved a lot. Will get on this soon. Documentation improvements needed: 
    - UI Improvements:
        - Nav bar shouldn't scroll up and away with the documentation/content.
        - Nav bar needs to be at the side not below on smaller screens
    - Documentation Improvements:
        - The way everything is written assumes that the user/reader has used SSGs or has had a blog before. Directly jumping into Taxonomies and Shortcodes with analogies given to Wordpress leaves a lot wanting. The analogies need to be more explicitand incase of taxonomies, I didn't know till I started using Themes, that themes used taxonomies so extensively.
